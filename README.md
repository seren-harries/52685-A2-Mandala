# 52685-A2-Mandala

This project is an interactive artwork that allows the user to draw a mandala in Processing. The user downloads the Processing file and runs the sketch. The code is based off a tutorial by YouTuber Barney Codes and has been modified. This code prototype  allows the user to draw circles and lines that are mirrored. The canvas is divided into 10 sectors by radians, which mirror the user's mouse movements to create a mandala. The colours are used in HSB, (Hue, Saturation and Brightness) so that it creates a gradient effect, the further away the mouse moves from the centre of the canvas, the colour changes. The math code functions were adapted from a YouTube explainer video of using math import on Processing. The lines are also considered "dynamic" in the sense that they are made up of ellipses to add depth to the code. The mouseDragged and mousePressed functions basically memorise where the user has drawn and creates the lines between the current and previous positions and follows the user's trackpad movements.
